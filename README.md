An error pops up every once and a while regarding the audio files, closing the browser 
and forcing refresh with ctrl-F5 seems to fix it. The error seems to be random yet common, though,
and any lack of sound I'm guessing is a problem with the browser.
    
    I had difficulties with animations and tweening being controlled through the DOM. 
    I was able to get them to work with a recursive function but decided not to use 
    them for the sake of simplicity and for my attention being put on learning how 
    to make the Myo controls and eventlisteners cooperate with A-Frame. However, my 
    first ideas with using physics eventlisteners did not pan out. But I was able to 
    alter my approach to have the scene react to eventlisteners rather than the 
    eventlisteners react to the scene.
